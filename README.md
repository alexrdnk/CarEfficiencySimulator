A sophisticated simulation tool for evaluating and comparing different railway system maintenance policies using statistical modeling and reliability engineering principles.

## üöÇ Overview

The Railway System Maintenance Simulator is a powerful tool designed to help railway operators and maintenance engineers optimize their maintenance strategies. It simulates different maintenance policies (Preventive, Reactive, and Predictive) and evaluates their impact on system reliability, costs, and performance metrics.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Multiple Maintenance Policy Simulation:**
  - Preventive Maintenance
  - Reactive Maintenance
  - Predictive Maintenance

- **Comprehensive Analysis Metrics:**
  - System Availability
  - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
  - Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)
  - Maintenance Costs
  - Component-specific failure rates
  - SLA compliance monitoring

- **Advanced Statistical Modeling:**
  - Weibull distribution for failure modeling
  - Monte Carlo simulation
  - Standard deviation analysis

- **Visualization and Reporting:**
  - Automated generation of comparative plots
  - CSV export functionality
  - Detailed logging system

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

### Configuration

The simulator uses a JSON configuration file (`maintenance_policies.json`) to define:
- Simulation parameters
- SLA targets
- Maintenance policy specifications
- Component-specific details

Example configuration structure:
```json
{
    "simulation_duration": 10000,
    "num_simulations": 100,
    "sla_targets": {
        "availability": 0.975,
        "max_downtime": 700
    },
    "maintenance_policies": [
        {
            "name": "Preventive Maintenance",
            "avg_usage_time": 500,
            ...
        }
    ]
}
```

### Running the Simulator

```bash
python simulation.py
```

## üìä Output

The simulator generates:

1. **CSV Results File** (`reliability_simulation_results.csv`):
   - Detailed metrics for each maintenance policy
   - Statistical analyses
   - SLA compliance status

2. **Visualization** (`maintenance_policy_comparison.png`):
   - Comparative bar charts for key metrics
   - System availability analysis
   - Cost comparison plots

## üìà Sample Results

Based on the simulation results:

- **Predictive Maintenance** achieves the highest availability (97.73%) with minimal downtime
- **Preventive Maintenance** maintains good availability (94.99%) with moderate costs
- **Reactive Maintenance** shows higher costs and lower availability (85.00%)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Key Classes

- `RailwaySystemSimulator`: Main simulation engine
- `MaintenancePolicy`: Policy configuration handler
- `Component`: Component-level specification manager

### Simulation Methodology

1. Utilizes Weibull distribution for realistic failure modeling
2. Implements Monte Carlo simulation for statistical reliability
3. Considers component-level and system-level failures
4. Accounts for maintenance costs and repair times
